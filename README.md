# Redux E-Commerce Site

## Description:

The main goal of this project is to build an e-commerce platform using Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API.

After completion of the project, I have a better understanding on building a full stack MERN application with Redux for state management, Stripe API for generating financial reports and analytics by using a single object to track each process, and the React library to improve the functionality, user experience, and create the VDOM to check and render the DOM. I also learned how to use reducers, mutations, and queries effectively to access and manipulate data.

## Test Instructions:

For testing and debugging, the application logs requests and errors in the console. Unit testing not configured. For further debugging feel free to check the sources in Dev Tools for front-end and JavaScript Debug Terminal for backend.

And be aware there is a current issue in the chrome dev tools in regards to blocked cookies with Stripe API. It is completely normal and will not affect the application.
